####### Original dataset provided by Walmart #########
######################################################
TripType - a categorical id representing the type of shopping trip the customer made. This is the ground truth that you are predicting. TripType_999 is an "other" category. (38 different kinds of categories in total)
VisitNumber - an id corresponding to a single trip by a single customer
Weekday - the weekday of the trip (monday to sunday)
Upc - the UPC number of the product purchased 
ScanCount - the number of the given item that was purchased. A negative value indicates a product return.
DepartmentDescription - a high-level description of the item's department
FinelineNumber - a more refined category for each of the products, created by Walmart

## A single VisitNumber has multiple rows. Each row is an item bought during the visit. A visit with multiple items bought will have multiple rows
## Efforts need to be made to flatten the original train dataset.

########### My dataset in my final model #############
######################################################
a) Weekday: Which day of the week (monday to friday). Dummy variable for each day.
b) Department Description: There are many kinds of department. Each department is a dummy variable forming a column.
c) finelinenumber: There are also many finelinenumber. Each finelinenumber is a dummy variable forming a column.
d) gotReturn: A dummy variable for trips with returned items. 1 for a trip consisting of at least a returned item. 0 for no returned item.
e) Weekdayend: A dummy variable for weekend or weekday trips. 1 for weekday, 0 for weekend.
f) number of items bought: A naive sum of the number of items bought. I believe that a deliberate trip to walmart will consist of more items bought, thus differentiating certain trips.
g) number of unique department description: A naive unique count of the number of department descriptions for that visit. A deliberate family trip will consist of more department descriptions. A short trip with an item in mind will have less.
h) number of unique UPC: A naive unique count of the number of Upc.
i) number of unique finelinenumber: A naive unique count of the number of type of finelinenumber.
